# MSC/CBC — Symbolic Core Proof of Concept

This repository provides visual proof of the successful simulation of the MSC (Module of Symbolic Coherence) and CBC (Coherence-Based Compression) technologies. These symbolic chips are based on a coherence-driven architecture rather than traditional clock-based processing.

## 🔍 What This Is

A 7-core symbolic engine was simulated using SystemVerilog on EDA Playground. Each core responds to symbolic input and executes parallel logic collapse. The outputs demonstrate correct, unique symbolic transformations—without any sequential instruction set or neural inference.

## 🧪 Proof of Execution

The video included in this repository shows:
- The execution of the full simulation in a public logic simulator (Icarus Verilog).
- The log output of all 7 cores.
- Unique symbolic results based on coherence input logic.

⚠️ **Code is not disclosed.**  
This project is under active development and partially protected by a provisional patent.

## 🧠 Why It Matters

Traditional chips are bound by brute-force logic. MSC/CBC uses:
- Symbolic entropy (H_C),
- Faith vectors (F_j),
- Collapse functions (Δ(n)),

...to compute symbolically, enabling cognition-like processing with ultra-low energy consumption.
