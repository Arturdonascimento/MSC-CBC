# MSC/CBC — A Symbolic Processor Architecture Without Clocks

**This repository presents the first working prototype of the CBC (Coherence-Based Compression) system, a symbolic engine that powers a new class of processors — the MSC (Minimal Symbolic Core).**

MSC processors are inspired by the architecture of the human brain. Instead of relying on clock signals, they operate using symbolic coherence — allowing computation within compressed, meaning-rich spaces.

## 🔍 What’s Inside

- `CBC_Compressor_v3_3.py`: Fully functional compressor/decompressor with GUI.
- `.cbc` files: Examples of compressed data (proof of concept).
- Video + screenshots: Demonstration of MSC cores running asynchronously via Verilog simulation (EDA Playground).

---

## 📌 Key Concepts

- **Symbolic Compression (CBC)**: Operates on positional entropy (`H_C(n)`) and symbolic coherence instead of frequency.
- **Clockless Processing (MSC)**: MSC cores process data when triggered by coherence thresholds — not by time steps.
- **Ethical Logic (Meira Protocol)**: Embedded moral safeguards for any future conscious systems.

## ❗ Known Limitations

This is a proof of concept — not a production-level compressor.

- In current tests, CBC **does not reduce file size**. In fact, many `.cbc` files are larger than their original text.
- The compression logic is symbolic and nonlinear — traditional benchmarks like `gzip` or `LZ77` outperform CBC in raw size reduction.

**We are not claiming superior compression** — we are demonstrating a new symbolic path for data representation.

## 🧭 Roadmap (2024–2026)

### ✅ Phase 1 — Proof of Concept (Completed)
- CBC v3.3 implemented and tested (Python GUI).
- Simulation of 7 parallel MSC cores using Verilog (EDA Playground).

## 🌌 Final Words

> *"If the binary age was about speed, the symbolic age will be about meaning."*

This is the first symbolic step toward a new paradigm: **efficient, ethical, interpretable computing** — free from clocks, driven by coherence.
